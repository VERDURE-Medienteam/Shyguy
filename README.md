# Shy Guy - Soft Hyphen Managing

Adds visualisation and control over soft hyphens in content elements to TYPO3.

## What does it do

Ever wondered how to force very long words to break into the next line if space gets too narrow?
This Extension adds an "insert soft hyphen" Button into the button bar at the top (next to save, view, eg. in content editing view).

## How to install

Just install the extension manual or via composer.
No configuration is needed.

## How does it work

Within a content element, a soft hyphen is set at the caret position if you click the button.
